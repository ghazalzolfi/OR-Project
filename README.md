Operations Research Project - Dual-Level Workforce Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing the hiring and compensation strategy for a company aiming to balance flexibility in work schedules and employee satisfaction. It is divided into two phases:

Phase 1: Mathematical Modeling:

The project begins with the creation of a dual-level optimization model.
The model addresses hiring decisions and wage determination while taking into account employee preferences for flexible work schedules (e.g., remote work, part-time).
The goal is to maximize company profit while minimizing the gap between the companyâ€™s offer and the employees' desired working conditions and compensation.

Phase 2: Coding and Sensitivity Analysis:

This phase involves implementing the model in a programming environment and running various scenarios.
Sensitivity analysis is conducted to observe the impact of different parameters, such as work-life balance options, employee preferences, and compensation schemes.
The results, including hiring strategies and compensation levels, are analyzed and reported.
